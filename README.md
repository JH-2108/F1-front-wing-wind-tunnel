# A Low-Cost Mini Wind Tunnel for Testing F1 Front Wing Aerodynamics

## Project Description
This project aims to design and build a compact, low-cost wind tunnel to visualize airflow and compare the aerodynamic performance of 3D-printed F1 front wing designs. Using simple materials like acrylic sheets, a PC blower fan, and a smoke generator, the wind tunnel will demonstrate how wing geometry affects downforce, drag, and flow separation. Three wing variations are planned: a base model, a high-downforce model, and a multi-element thinner model. This project explores real mechanical and aerospace engineering principles in a hands-on way.

## Next Steps
- Design and 3D-print the F1 front wing models  
- Build the wind tunnel test section  
- Add smoke generator for airflow visualization  
- Conduct experiments and record observations  
- Update the repo with CAD files, photos, and experiment data
